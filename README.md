# Active Defense with Honey Pot and Development of a Python Tool for Brute Force Attack Detection
## Project for the Academic year : 2023/2024

## Introduction:
As part of our final year project, we have chosen to focus on setting up a honeynet to enhance
active defense capabilities against cyberattacks. A honeypot is a system designed to attract
attackers by simulating vulnerabilities or security flaws, in order to detect, analyze, and
understand their techniques and behaviors. When multiple honeypots are integrated into a
network, it is referred to as a honeynet, which allows for more extensive monitoring and
in-depth analysis of compromise attempts.
We have chosen this topic due to its growing importance in the field of cybersecurity. With
the constant increase in cyber threats, companies and organizations are seeking proactive
ways to detect and prevent attacks. Honeynets offer an effective solution to trap attackers,
gather valuable intelligence, and improve defense strategies.
